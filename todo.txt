# check if the button has been clicked
# events
# 1. Create a new list all_buttons in game class which will hold our buttons
# 2. Add all buttons to our new list
# 3. Create a new function in Button class that takes a pos and returns 
a boolean if that pos is within the range of the button
# 4. in game.show_start_screen function check if mouse button has been pressed
# if pressed, loop through the list of our buttons and check if any of the button 
colided with the mouse
# by running the check_if_collided method on each button and passing in the mouse 
position
# 5. if true - assign button.buttonValue to self.pressed
#self.pressed = str(pygame.mouse.get_pressed()) # returns -  (bool, bool, bool) 
returns if mouse has been pressed
#self.pressed = str(pygame.mouse.get_pos())  #  returns - (int, int) 
returns the position of the mouse


1. Create a new variable in Game class that will hold the information
